# Example-11.3

Due to an aggressive marketing strategy, LonBank Inc., a regional bank, has recently seen an increase in the number of loan applications it processes. Its regional manager has therefore decided to build a new loan center adjacent to one of its branches. Four square offices of equal area are to be located in the new square building. The locations in the building to which departments may be assigned are shown in Figure 11.19. Formulate the problem as a QAP using the data in Figure 11.20, which indicates the trips made by bank personnel and customers between each pair of offices.
